# theoProgCompiler

This Java program comprises a graphical user interface (GUI) that facilitates the lexical, syntax, and semantic analysis of a given text file. The application presents a window with buttons to open a file, perform lexical analysis, syntax analysis, semantic analysis, and clear the interface.

Upon selecting a file, the program performs lexical analysis to categorize and assess elements like data types, identifiers, delimiters, and values within the code. Subsequently, it progresses to syntax analysis, verifying the correctness of syntactic constructs like data type declarations, identifier assignments, and delimiters. Finally, it conducts semantic analysis to evaluate the logical coherence and correctness of the code's structure and content.
